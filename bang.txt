<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Amazingly crisp chicken bites drizzled with sweet chili mayo – so good, you’ll want to double or triple the recipe! </p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>⅓ cup milk</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
<li>1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch cubes </li>
<li>¼ cup potato starch</li>
<li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li> 
<li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
<li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
<li>¼ teaspoon shichimi togarashi (Japanese red pepper condiment)</li>
<li>oil for frying</li>
<li>¼ cup mayonnaise</li>
<li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
<li>2 tablespoons sweet chili sauce</li>
<li>1 teaspoon gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)</li>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
<li>Whisk together milk and egg in a bowl until smooth. Add chicken to egg wash and marinate for 15 minutes. Drain.</li>
<li>Combine potato starch, flour, salt, pepper, and ground red pepper in a bowl and transfer into a large resealable bag. Add egg-washed chicken pieces and shake until each piece is completely dredged</li>
<li>Heat oil in a large skillet to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
<li>Add chicken pieces into the oil in batches, about 5 to 8 pieces at a time, so as not to drop the temperature of the oil. Fry for 90 seconds. Remove to a paper-towel lined plate to drain. Fry remaining chicken pieces.</li>
<li>Increase oil temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). The oil should be continuously boiling at this point. Carefully re-add the first batch of chicken and fry another 90 seconds. Remove to a paper-towel lined plate to drain. Fry and drain the remaining chicken. Transfer chicken to a medium bowl.</li>
<li>Stir mayonnaise, honey, sweet chili sauce, and gochujang together in a small bowl. Toss fried chicken with sauce to coat.</li></ol>
